This project is an updated version of the project found at
http://trac.neotitans.net/wiki/lhafile

Changes include:
* Support for Python 3.x.
* Support file notes (as found in Amiga .lha files).
* Support for archives with ISO-8859-1 filenames.
* Fixed a bug causing crashes in lzhlib.

I've also updated setup.py and replaced the author information there.
This is not done to remove any credit, but to avoid people bugging the
original author if there is a problem with my modifications.

README.txt is the original upstream README.
